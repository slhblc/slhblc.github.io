Swift Calc-Calc Calculator

This assignment was one of the first projects we did, and it was pretty simple to understand. The program takes two numbers from the user and then performs basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Once the numbers are entered, the calculator instantly shows the results using the logic built into the code. Even though it wasnâ€™t too challenging, it was a fun and satisfying task that helped me get comfortable with Swift and basic user input.
