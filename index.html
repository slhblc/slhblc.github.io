  <section id="about">
    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I‚Äôm a student who loves coding, tech, and learning new things. I especially enjoy working on SwiftUI projects and experimenting with creative app designs.</p>
  </section>

  <section id="projects">
    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <h3>üç¶ Ice Cream Cone App</h3>
    <p>This SwiftUI project demonstrates how state management and view composition can be combined to create an interactive and visually engaging interface. The goal of the app was to simulate building an ice cream cone by stacking colorful scoops on top of a cone.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection on the Ice Cream Cone App</strong></p>
    <p>The main learning outcome was understanding how @State variables control dynamic changes in the UI. The numberOfScoops state determines how many scoops are displayed, and SwiftUI automatically re-renders the view when this value changes. This reactive design pattern makes SwiftUI efficient and intuitive compared to manually updating the UI.</p>
    <p>The use of ForEach enabled the app to dynamically generate multiple scoop layers, each assigned a unique color from a predefined array. The ZStack and VStack combinations allowed for layered and vertical stacking, which made it simple to position scoops correctly above the cone.</p>
    <p>Additionally, I explored animation in SwiftUI using the <code>.animation(.spring())</code> modifier to create smooth transitions when adding or resetting scoops. This subtle motion gives the interface a more playful and polished feel.</p>
    <p>Through this project, I also learned the importance of layout alignment and offset adjustments, which were essential to visually balance the scoops on the cone. Furthermore, handling the ‚Äúoverflow‚Äù condition ‚Äî where too many scoops reset the count ‚Äî introduced a simple but effective example of conditional logic and user feedback.</p>

    <h3>üïí Swift Clock App</h3>
    <p>This SwiftUI project creates a real-time analog clock where you can manually adjust the hour and minute hands. The background color changes based on AM or PM, making it both functional and visually dynamic.</p>

    <h3>üí° Binary Counter App</h3>
    <p>This project is a binary counter made with SwiftUI. It visually represents the binary form of numbers using colored rectangles that update in real-time as you increase or reset the counter.</p>

    <h3>üßÆ Calculator App</h3>
    <p>A simple and clean calculator app created with SwiftUI. It performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with an elegant interface.</p>

    <p><strong>Calculator Reflection</strong></p>
    <p>Swift Calc-Calc Calculator ‚Äî This assignment was one of the first projects we did, and it was pretty simple to understand. The program takes two numbers from the user and then performs basic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Once the numbers are entered, the calculator instantly shows the results using the logic built into the code. Even though it wasn‚Äôt too challenging, it was a fun and satisfying task that helped me get comfortable with Swift and basic user input.</p>

    <h3>‚ùå‚≠ï Tic Tac Toe (XOX) Game</h3>
    <p>This SwiftUI game allows two players to play the classic Tic Tac Toe (XOX) game. It includes win detection, a reset button, and a modern, colorful design.</p>

    <h3>Scratch XOX Game</h3>
    <p>This scratch game allows users to play XOX (tic tac toe) made with Scratch visual coding.</p>

    <h3>Compression Reflection</h3>
    <p><strong>Data Compression</strong></p>
    <p>1. <b>Why is data compressed and what algorithms are used?</b><br>Data is compressed to reduce file size and save storage or bandwidth. Many files contain repeating information that doesn‚Äôt need to be stored multiple times. Compression algorithms find and simplify those patterns. Lossless compression keeps every bit of data exactly the same after decompression, while Lossy compression removes details that aren‚Äôt easily noticed. Common algorithms include Huffman Coding, Run-Length Encoding, and Lempel-Ziv (used in ZIP files).</p>
    <p>2. <b>Is compression the same for videos, photos, and text?</b><br>The main goal‚Äîremoving unnecessary or repetitive data‚Äîis the same, but the techniques differ. Text files require lossless compression since every character matters. On the other hand, videos, photos, and audio files can use lossy compression, because small details that the human eye or ear can‚Äôt detect can be removed safely.</p>
    <p>3. <b>What programs perform compression (online or installed)?</b><br>There are both web-based and desktop tools. Online tools like TinyPNG or ILovePDF compress files directly in the browser. Installed programs such as WinRAR, 7-Zip, or Adobe Acrobat perform compression locally on your computer.</p>
    <p>4. <b>Examples of compression in pictures, videos, text, and PDFs:</b><br>Image compression removes subtle color differences or merges similar shades. Video compression saves space by recording only the changes between frames instead of every single frame. Text compression often replaces repeating words or patterns with shorter symbols. PDF compression minimizes image resolution and removes extra embedded data like unused fonts.</p>
    <p>5. <b>Common compressed formats:</b><br>
    Video: MP4, AVI, MOV<br>
    Image: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP<br>
    Audio: MP3, AAC, FLAC<br>
    Text/Documents: TXT, DOCX, PDF, ZIP</p>
