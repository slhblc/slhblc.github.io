    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I‚Äôm a student who loves coding, tech, and learning new things. I especially enjoy working on SwiftUI projects and experimenting with creative app designs.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>

    <h3>üïí Swift Clock App</h3>
    <p>This SwiftUI project creates a real-time analog clock where you can manually adjust the hour and minute hands. The background color changes based on AM or PM, making it both functional and visually dynamic.</p>

    <h3>üí° Binary Counter App</h3>
    <p>This project is a binary counter made with SwiftUI. It visually represents the binary form of numbers using colored rectangles that update in real-time as you increase or reset the counter.</p>

    <h3>üßÆ Calculator App</h3>
    <p>A simple and clean calculator app created with SwiftUI. It performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division with an elegant interface.</p>

    <p>How did Pair Programming help you complete this task?
Pair Programming helped us work more efficiently because we could focus on different parts of the task at the same time. The driver wrote the Swift code while the navigator checked for mistakes and suggested better ways to write it. It made finding errors faster and helped us learn from each other.

What is the purpose of your program?
The purpose of the program is to perform basic math operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulo based on the user‚Äôs choice. It allows the user to do calculations repeatedly until they decide to quit.

Which steps did you follow when designing your program?
First, we planned the structure of the program and listed the operations we needed. Then we created a menu and added user input for the operation and numbers. After that, we used a switch statement to perform the right calculation, added error checks for dividing or taking modulo by zero, and finally tested the program.

Which errors did you encounter, and how did you fix them?
At first, the program didn‚Äôt handle division by zero correctly and caused a runtime error. We fixed it by adding an if statement that checks if the second number is zero before dividing. We also fixed small syntax mistakes, like missing parentheses, during testing.</p>

    <h3>‚ùå‚≠ï Tic Tac Toe (XOX) Game</h3>
    <p>This SwiftUI game allows two players to play the classic Tic Tac Toe (XOX) game. It includes win detection, a reset button, and a modern, colorful design.</p>

    <h3>Scratch XOX Game</h3>
    <p>This scratch games allow to play XOX also known as tic tac toe</p>

    <h3>Compression Reflection</h3>
    <p>Data Compression

1. Why is data compressed and what algorithms are used?
Data is compressed to reduce file size and save storage or bandwidth. Many files contain repeating information that doesn‚Äôt need to be stored multiple times. Compression algorithms find and simplify those patterns. Lossless compression keeps every bit of data exactly the same after decompression, while Lossy compression removes details that aren‚Äôt easily noticed. Common algorithms include Huffman Coding, Run-Length Encoding, and Lempel-Ziv (used in ZIP files).

2. Is compression the same for videos, photos, and text?
The main goal‚Äîremoving unnecessary or repetitive data‚Äîis the same, but the techniques differ. Text files require lossless compression since every character matters. On the other hand, videos, photos, and audio files can use lossy compression, because small details that the human eye or ear can‚Äôt detect can be removed safely.

3. What programs perform compression (online or installed)?
There are both web-based and desktop tools. Online tools like TinyPNG or ILovePDF compress files directly in the browser. Installed programs such as WinRAR, 7-Zip, or Adobe Acrobat perform compression locally on your computer.

4. Examples of compression in pictures, videos, text, and PDFs
Image compression removes subtle color differences or merges similar shades. Video compression saves space by recording only the changes between frames instead of every single frame. Text compression often replaces repeating words or patterns with shorter symbols. PDF compression minimizes image resolution and removes extra embedded data like unused fonts.

5. Common compressed formats

Video: MP4, AVI, MOV

Image: JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP

Audio: MP3, AAC, FLAC

Text/Documents: TXT, DOCX, PDF, ZIP</p>
